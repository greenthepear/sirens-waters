    <b>Aranya</b> is the first exoplanet colonized by humans. It orbits Aranya Alpha within a star system of the same name among 4 other planets, located 15.2 light years from the Solar system. It has a circumference around 1.1 times that of Earth, and is orbited by two moons: Laika and Baker.

    Aranya's surface is about 51% covered in salt water oceans, the vast majority of land being a lush jungle with alien fauna, flora and funga, all three known to be dangerous to humans. The composition of aranyan soil and airborne micro-organisms make it impossible for human agriculture in non-specialized envoriments.

    Although the planet was discovered by the James Webb Telescope on the 12th of May 2025, research interest greatly increased after a strong seemingly structured radio signal was detected from the direction of the star system on the 6th of June 2027, now know as <b><a href="sirens_song.html">Siren's song</a></b>.

    First successful unmanned flyby mission finished in 2098, the first orbiter and lander in 2110 and 2120 respectfully. Spaceflight to Aranya increased drastically after the invention of <b>the Superluminal</b> in 2122, allowing for faster-than-light travel. After an international effort, the first permanent manned orbital space station <b>'Bridge'</b> made it possible for humans to make landfall in 2131. In 2137 and 2142 respectfully, two bigger space stations were created - <b>'Treehouse'</b> and <b>'Crown'</b>, by the time of which human settlement on the <b>Horn Peninsula</b> reached a million people, with the support of orbital farming on the aforementioned space stations.

    After <b><a href="/awakening.html">the Awakening</a></b>, space stations no longer exist in aranyan orbit, and the estimated 120k people on the planet are fully isolated from any type of communication with Earth.
