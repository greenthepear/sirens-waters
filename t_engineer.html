            I'm already setting in and already missing you. I'm also missing my office even though the baracks are better than I imagined. Spacious but not very private, I'll figure out sheets or something to hide behind. You'd think they would have something separate for the engineers but we're all here together with the workers. At least I don't have to worry about food and included a bluemoss bar in the letter - enjoy, I hear these are tasteless.
        </p>
        <p>
            The view is probably the best part. The beach is beautiful but we're not even allowed to dip our toes in. Ironic considering what we'll be doing for the next few months. I don't want to jinx it but the ROVs have been doing a decent job so far on their own, pray so it stays that way.

            Good news, we got a decent temporary entrance completed and we only lost one ROV. There were some fish but they didn't touch the construction themselves. If we keep up this pace we can get this thing done in like 3 months tops, at least before the agros can go in.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's not much to do here since we're not allowed to either go into the jungle or swim. A lot of beachwalking, pretty much the only pastime. I'm already half way done with 'Never Let Me Go', and while I usually love old Earth literature, this isn't an easy read. People are doing overtime to keep themselves busy, including myself. I'll try my best to not overwork myself but the more we work the faster we can go home and feed everyone.

            Milestone reached, I had the (mis)fortune of having to dive in. I appreciate the change in pace and not having to rely on these slow and input delayed robots but I pray they come back. Somehow they all went out and we had to get in before a collapse would happen. I've been assured there was no fish but the omnipresent darkness at the ocean floor makes me imagine things. It was quick, thankfully.
        </p>
        <p>
            I sort of regret reading this book, probably not a good moment to read something like that. I've been reading instruction manuals instead to keep my mind off things instead. These letters help a lot too. I hope you read them.

            Had a scary situation today. I was descending because these pieces of garbage keep losing their signal, but they fished us out suddenly when they read things approaching. I saw them. They think I'm crazy since they read them miles away, there was supposed to be no way for me to have them in sight with such shitty visibility. It was close and I felt the water move with them. Rationally I should know that it was in my head but I can't convince myself. The recent rise didn't help, nor my coworkers' similar stories. They're sending a shrink, but you know how useful that is. At least they put me off water duty for the week.
        </p>
        <p>
            They didn't let me send you bluemoss again, even though I was okay with sending my ration. I hope you're eating well.

            Someone in correspondence was telling people about the project. Please respect the NDA or we'll both get in trouble. You can also put yourself in danger. If people know what we're making they might try to steal from you even though you're far away and we didn't make anything yet. We also don't want the public to get their hopes up.

            We lost one today. Thankfully it wasn't a fish, but someone messed up the measurements in a storage tank and the fucking thing imploded while he was inside. Cannot give names, but the silverlining is that it wasn't one of my friends. Fucked up thing to say, I know, but I don't how to cope otherwise. I worked on that tank, I really hope it wasn't my fault. They say there's no time for an investigation so that possibility might haunt me for a long while.
        </p>
        <p>
            Good news is that we fixed some of the ROVs and they're supposed to send us more. Everyone is volunteering to work on fixing these things day and night as long as they're promised no dive duty. Hell, the few people that want to dive in do so just to fish out the broken ones, that's how bad it is. It makes me uneasy though, if everyone's sleep deprived that's asking for another accident.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tank shouldn't set us back too long. I'm still hopeful we can get out of here in a couple months.

            The excavated area is getting decently big, only minor leaks so far. The only problem is that the preliminary research on the soil samples says it's somehow not good for agro at all, even though the scientists ASSURED us this is the right place. Right under it? Thick arstone. I REALLY hope we just need to cut through the rock otherwise what's the fucking point in all this? Two people dead, and 6 months of sleeping through nightmares about the darkness, for fucking nothing.

            Excuse my language, I really needed to get this off my chest.

            We fucking did it, babe. The soil is good, we just had to get through the rocks like I said. We had to use explosives which of course brought in more fish, but honestly as we wait for them to leave I appreciate the down time. Finally some decent sleep.

            The fish problem is still bad, there's really not much to do, some people smuggled in uptashrooms, boss somehow only gave a slap on the wrist for them getting high. I guess he understands.
        </p>
        <p>
            They're gonna send in the military, they will try to get the fish away. I hope they don't blow up our whole work during it.

            We got some impressive tech from the south. They remodeled the ROVs with scanners and actual weapons, they've been blowing up the fish left and right. Some carcasses made it up, I could get a close look at the monsters taunting me the past, what is it, almost a year now? It was horrid. Maybe it was because it was shot but I cannot even bring myself to describe how this thing looked like. It was a sight of sin, and I do not know if that's because it itself was sin, or we have committed sin by killing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to go home.

            We did it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's complete. Well, at least the structure. Solid and exandable if needed. The dock works. Agros will now do home renovations to make the plants cozy but our job is done.
        </p>
        <p>
            It might have been the hardest week yet. We were worried that the whole thing will collapse after we left the site alone for so long waiting for the fish to leave, so we had to catch up. ROVs were repurposed by the military so it was on us to finish construction asap. The fish never went away, but the new robots kept us safe. We were working while they were shooting down the fuckers. While we were working! It was like fireworks. Complete darkness interrupted by flashes of light from torpedoes. If I looked at the flash, more often than not I would see a shadow of the fish, I could only pray that it was a hit, and the torpedo didn't simply blow up behind it. Eitherway it always looked like it was coming straight at me. I had to stop looking around, I couldn't stand to notice their outlines, I was trying my best to focus on the construction, if the thing was coming - so be it as long as I don't see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was only a few days of that hell, but it felt like it was longer than the entire rest of the year. We would swap out constantly to avoid exhaustion, but the dread everyone felt when they knew they were going back in a couple of hours didn't let anyone rest. The descent every day, as you swam past the corpses and spilled out guts of these monsters, did not help. No one died, somehow. Only a few injuries caused by torpedoes expoding right next to the workers, right before a fish was about to get them, just meters away in some cases. I'm one of the few lucky ones that does not know what the sight of that is.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should be home soon. I guess should say that I hope that the farm we made will work and feed people, but as long as I never come back to the water, I will be content.
