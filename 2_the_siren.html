    <b>The siren</b>, also known as <b>the organism</b>, <b>the leviathan</b>, <b>the eel</b>, <b>the snake</b>, <b>satan</b>, <b>mara</b> and many others, is a giant, seemingly carbon-based, living organism orbiting <a href="1_aranya.html">Aranya</a>, a few kilometers above its atmosphere.
</section>

<section>
    It is about 1100 km long and 150 km wide, the shape of the body vaguely resembling an eel or tadpole with a thicker "head" leading the orbiting direction and a slimmer "tail" coming off it. Also familiar are its slithering movements which are subtle but noticeable with the naked eye from the surface. The entire surface of the organism is dark green and uniformly fleshy and veiny with no discernible features although it is very common to perceive eyes and a mouth on the head, often in resemblance of an anglerfish or other sea creatures but perception as religious entities is also frequently reported.

    The siren orbits Aranya since <b><a href="3_the_awakening.html">the Awakening</a></b> but is unknown how the siren propelled itself there or how it sustains itself in the vacuum of space. It extrudes a great amount of heat which can be felt on the surface. It also causes electronic malfunction on all objects in orbit, even while on the other side of the planet and disrupts most forms of electromagnetic radiation from outside Aranya, especially radio waves. This to a lesser extend includes visible light which causes novel optical phenomena on the aranyan sky while the organism is flying by and visible. Combination of these properties makes communication and transport from and to the surface of the planet impossible.

<section>
    Scientifically the organism remains unexplained.
</section>

<section>
    The siren nearly universally causes adverse physical or at least psychological effects on humans when seen from the surface. It is unknown if this is just a combination of the trauma caused by the Awakening and subsequent aranyan isolation, the optical almost hallucinogenic phenomena and the organism's effect on radiation or another unexplained property that directly harms humans.

<section>
    It is generally believed that the <a href="4_sirens_song.html">siren's song</a> is the siren's doing, hence the nickname.
