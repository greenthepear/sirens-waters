  <p><strong>Bostonianism</strong> (known by many other names) is a belief that re-establishing contact with Earth is futile and aranyans should instead fully focus on establishing self-sustainance. More radical bostonians also believe that Earth has fully abandoned and betrayed Aranya after the Awakening or directly blame the colonization for the Siren. The varying degree of resentment towards Earth throughout the movement also results in opposition of attempts to escape Aranya. </p>
  <p>In a more general sense the doctorine can also describe the opposition to the General Colonial Government.</p>
  <h1>Name</h1>
  <p>The name <em>bostonian</em> comes from the city New Boston where the "We are Earth's orphans" essay/manifesto by Petr Jogiches was written, where the ideology mainly spread from and where the capital of the bostonian Free Aranya Republic lies. It can also refer to Earth's historical Boston Tea Party, which is analogous to the movement's history. Because of the essay's name <em>orphanism</em> is also used, as well as just <em>aryanism</em>.</p>
  <p>Older terminology is also common, such as: <em>autarkism</em>, <em>seperatism</em>, <em>secessionism</em>, <em>anti-colonialism</em> and <em>jacobinism</em>.</p>

  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Petr Jogiches' manifesto was written in the second year of the Great Famine, as a direct responce to the GCG's failed attempts to put new farming and communication infrastructure in orbit. These projects were seen as desperate and a waste of resources which could've been instead used to quell the famine. Jogiches belived that GCG's focus on reestablishing contact with Earth above all else was because of colonial incompetence, that GCG leadership was unable to act without Earth's orders. These beliefs reflected that of the general public, but especially in New Boston which was the most isolated city of its size from GCG's capital. These circumstances led to the city being the stronghold and birthplace of the Famished Uprising, and eventually the became the capital of the newly formed Free Aranya Republic.</p>

  <h1>Opposition</h1>
  <p><strong>Londonism</strong> (derived from the Boston Tea Party analogy), <strong>anti-bostonianism</strong>, <strong>earthism</strong> or <strong>loyalism</strong> is the belief that re-establishing communication with earth is the only chance for aranyan survival, often by the means of escaping from the planet.</p>
  <h1>Culpabilism</h1>
  <p><strong>Culpabilism</strong> (from latin <em>culpabilis</em>) is the belief that human activity is to blame for the Awakening, which is an aspect of bostonian ideology. The term though is usually used to refer to derived extremist ideologies which differ in ideals on the supported responce to this realization:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p><strong>sacri-culpablisim</strong>: "the Siren is a holy entity that must be worshipped if we want to see her mercy", a common precept of new religious movements on Aranya</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>post-culpabilism</strong>: "we deserve the suffering the Siren has caused, we must continue to live and suffer for it is justice on us"</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>culpa-extinctionism</strong>: "humanity needs to be removed from Aranya", generally acted upon through terrorism and mass suicide in supporting groups</p>
  </li>
  </ul>
